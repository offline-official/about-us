## 💡 Why We Built Offline

As digital communication and online interaction become more prevalent, we noticed people were missing the spontaneous connections and local communities that used to form naturally. Offline bridges this gap by making it easy to find and participate in real-world activities with people nearby.

## 🌟 Our Vision

We're not just building an app - we're fostering communities. Our goal is to help millions of people worldwide break out of their routines, try new activities, and form genuine connections in their local areas.
